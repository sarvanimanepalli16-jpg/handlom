        Handloom sarees showcase India’s diverse cultural heritage. These sarees are mostly found in cotton and silk. Handloom sarees are more than just a mere style statement. It reflects your unique preferences and refined tastes. When you wear these sarees on big occasions like weddings, it symbolises your status to everyone. If you are willing to buy handloom sarees, connect with traditional saree retailers in Kolkata. Despite the magnificence and opulence of handloom sarees, most of us aren’t aware of the steps involved in handloom saree manufacturing.At Mrinayani M.P.Govt. Emporium, you get access to diverse varieties of handloom sarees at competitive prices. Our traditional saree showroom in Kolkata houses high-end handloom sarees that are a great example of exquisite craftsmanship. The magnificent weaves, enticing fabrics, and beautiful carvings on our handloom sarees will spice up your look in ways more than you imagined.Yarn: It is a long chain of interlocked fibres. The thickness of yarn spun is determined by the standard length of cotton. Yarn is widely used in handloom production. Hand spinning: It is the method of transforming the cotton fibre into yarn. Usually, hand spinning is conducted manually or mechanically in different thicknesses. Dyeing: Dyeing is the process of removing dirt and natural oil in cotton. Thereafter, chemical or natural dyes are implemented for colouring. If you want to know more about this process, ask the retailers of a traditional saree shop in Kolkata to get a basic idea. Bobbin Winding: In this process, the yarn is wound onto bobbins. It transforms the look and feel of yarn. After winding, the yarn gets a linear form. The yarn lengths are laid out for weaving. Warping: It is the method of creating the base yarn that traverses the fabric. During warping, the “weft” yarns get caught up to make the fabric. Street sizing: Natural adhesives are applied to the warps after they are stretched out. These materials enhance the yarn’s strength to withstand weaving. Usually, sizing of the yarn is conducted on the street, and hence, referred to as ‘street sizing.’ Weft winding: The weft yarn is wound onto a pin and inserted into a shuttle. Weft winding is done on the charka to give the right tension to the yarn. Weaving: The handloom weavers interlace the two sets of yarn—the weft and the warp using an equipment known as a ‘loom’. A “handloom” is a special type of loom that weaves fabric without using electricity.
